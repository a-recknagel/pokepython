# Pok√©Python
Your pokemon player is randomly selected from a total of 15 pokemon sprites every time you restart or advance a level. There are 4 levels of progressively more difficult questions on the Python language, and each correct answer will give a speed boost of 100m (in a 1000m dash). All questions are taken from [My Python Quiz]. (http://mypythonquiz.com/)

Run `python game.py` to play.
